          <p> <b>A bit about me: </b> <br> <br> <br> I've just finished my degree in Computer Science at 
            the University of Bristol, with a breadth of experience in many areas of the subject.
            <br> <br> 
            Have a browse through this page to see some of my work which ranges from personal,
            university, and industry projects. 
            <br> <br> 
            I take great pride in all my work and am fuelled by coffee and squashies, so if you want 
            someone's heart and soul poured into a project just fulfill these criteria and I'll be away!

              <h3>Graphics renderer</h3>
              <p>I developed an engine for rendering 3D graphics models from first principles using C++.
                I implemented three rendering modes: wireframe, rasterised, and ray traced.

              <h3>BSc Dissertation Thesis</h3>
              <p>Titled "Deep Metric Learning for the Visual Identification of Individual Cattle from Depth Imagery",
                my project was in the sphere of deep learning for agriculture. I curated a new dataset and purpose designed
                a network architecture for the task of identifying individual cattle from depth imagery alone.</p>

              <h3>AR Messaging</h3>
              <p>As part of IBM's Academic Initiative, I worked in a team of four to create an Android Application
                called SkyWrite. Users can send augmented reality messages to a postcode which would
                notify all users in that location to view the message above them in the sky.

              <h3>Decisions and Disruptions</h3>
              <p>Working as an associate researcher for Bristol University, I created a virtual version of
                "Decisions and Disruptions", which is a tabletop game to teach cyber security best practise.
                This virtual version of the game was commissioned by the Metropolitan Police Force, and is implemented
                in Java using SwingUI (rest assured this was not my decision) </p>

              <h3>ML Technique Analysis</h3>
              <p>I demonstrated my understanding of key machine learning algorithms in a report analysing 
                experiments on the Fashion-MNIST and California Housing datasets. I received a grade of 80% for this
                final year university project.

              <h3>This little website</h3>
              <p>I've not got much experience of web dev but wanted to quickly whip up a little personal 
                site despite that! If I have a bit of spare time I'd love to make the website more professional and dynamic, 
                but hopefully it serves its purpose ok for now. </p>
